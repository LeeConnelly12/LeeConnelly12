### üìù About me

As a web developer with over five years of commercial experience, I specialize in building scalable and reliable applications using Laravel and Vue.js. I am highly skilled in writing tests and take pride in producing high-quality code. When I'm not coding, you'll find me staying up to date on the latest technologies and trends in web development. Currently working as a software engineer at [Patchworks](https://www.wearepatchworks.com).
